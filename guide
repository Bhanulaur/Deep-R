Features of the App:
	1.	User Registration:
	•	The /api/auth/register endpoint allows users to register by providing their name, email, and password.
	•	The password is hashed using bcryptjs before being stored in the database.
	2.	User Login:
	•	The /api/auth/login endpoint authenticates users by checking their email and password.
	•	Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the client. This token is required to access protected routes.
	3.	Profile Management:
	•	Get Profile: The /api/users/profile endpoint retrieves the authenticated user’s profile details.
	•	
Update Profile: The /api/users/profile endpoint allows users to update their name, email, and profile.


Delete Profile: The /api/users/profile endpoint deletes the user’s profile.
	4.	JWT Authentication:
	•	The app uses JWT tokens to secure API routes. The token is sent in the Authorization header for protected routes.
	•	The authenticate middleware checks the token and allows access to routes only if the token is valid.
